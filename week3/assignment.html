                <h2>Part 1: SQL</h2>
                <p>Write at least <strong>five</strong> SQL statements for one or two tables in your CartoDB account. Base them on a variety of the queries under Common Queries in the <a href="materials/sql-cheatsheet.pdf">SQL Reference</a>. Some should be mappable and some should be unmappable (eg, selecting the <code>COUNT</code> of a table, since that cannot be mapped).</p>
                <p>Submit:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the SQL that you performed and</li>
                    <li>the output of the SQL, either a screenshot of the resulting table or of the map, as appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>Part 2: Spatial SQL, Map Kibera</h2>
                TODO maybe buffer and select instead?
                <p>We're going to work through using SQL to locate features within other features using the Map Kibera data. This looks long, but that's mostly because we're going step-by-step. Follow along:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Download <a href="http://data.mapkibera.org/mapkibera/kibera/data/shapefile/education-shapefile.zip">education</a> and <a href="http://data.mapkibera.org/mapkibera/kibera/data/shapefile/boundary-shapefile.zip">boundaries</a> data if you don't already have them.</li>
                    <li>Upload the education and boundaries data to CartoDB. Rename the boundaries table to <code>kiberaboundaries</code>.</li>
                    <li>Let's try selecting boundaries by name:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open the <code>kiberaboundaries</code> table.</li>
                            <li>In the SQL tab enter the following:
                                <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * 
FROM kiberaboundaries
WHERE name = 'Makina'</code></pre>
                            </li>
                            <li>Two rows should be shown. Click the <strong>Map View</strong> button to see just those features.</li>
                            <li>Try another name from the table and see what the result is.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Now let's look at the education table:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open the <code>education</code> table.</li>
                            <li>In the SQL tab delete the old query and enter the following:
                                <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT *
FROM education
WHERE type = 'primary'</code></pre>
                            </li>
                            <li>Only the primary schools should show be displayed. Look at the <strong>Map View</strong>. This is not a required step, just making sure that the table is loaded correctly and SQL works.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>We're going to join the <code>education</code> table with the <code>kiberaboundaries</code> table. While looking at the <code>education</code> table, delete the old SQL query and enter the following SQL:
                        <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT education.*
FROM education, kiberaboundaries
WHERE ST_within(education.the_geom, kiberaboundaries.the_geom)</code></pre>
                        <p>Let's look at this statement line by line:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT education.*</code></pre>
                                    Selects all the columns from <code>education</code>.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                <pre><code class="language-sql">FROM education, kiberaboundaries</code></pre>
                                    We want to have <code>education</code> for its columns, but we also want <code>kiberaboundaries</code> to be available for the next line.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                <pre><code class="language-sql">WHERE ST_within(education.the_geom, kiberaboundaries.the_geom)</code></pre>
                                    Finally, we're only selecting the <code>education</code> rows where <code>the_geom</code> (the point for the row) is within one of the <code>kiberaboundaries</code> rows' <code>the_geom</code>.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Since we're basically saying "select all the features in Kibera" and we know all the features are in Kibera, we should still see all the features. Look at <strong>Map View</strong> and confirm.</li>
                    <li>To pick only <code>education</code> features that are within particular boundaries, now all we have to do is use conditions to pick those boundaries. Make your SQL query look like this:
                        <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT education.*
FROM education, kiberaboundaries
WHERE ST_within(education.the_geom, kiberaboundaries.the_geom)
AND kiberaboundaries.name = 'Makina'</code></pre>
                        <p>You should be able to add the last line (<code class="language-sql">AND kiberaboundaries.name = 'Makina'</code>) to the SQL you already have.</p>
                        <p>The last line specifies that we only want to look at <code>kiberaboundaries</code> with the <code>name</code> attribute set to 'Makina'. So when the database is looking for <code>education</code> features to include, it only considers those that are <em>within</em> <code>kiberaboundaries</code> with this name.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now that we have this query, we can change the name and see different <code>education</code> features appear on the map. In your SQL, replace <code>Makina</code> with <code>Ayany</code>. Confirm that only those features are selected by looking at the <strong>Map View</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Finally, we can filter the <code>education</code> filters more by adding conditions to our query. Switch the <code>name</code> back to <code>Makina</code> and add the following line:
                    <pre><code class="language-sql">AND education.type = 'primary'</code></pre>
                        <p>Now we're only selecting <code>education</code> features in Makina that are primary schools.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>That's it! You're using spatial SQL queries. Submit a screenshot with the result and your final code.</p>
