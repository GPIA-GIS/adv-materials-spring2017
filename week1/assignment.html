                <h2>Part 1: geojson.io</h2>
                <p>Experiment with <a href="http://geojson.io/">geojson.io</a>.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create some data. Your data should include at least <em>five</em> geometries and should have at least <em>one</em> attribute (column) that is populated for each geometry (in the <strong>Table</strong> section on the right side of the site). Try including multiple geometry types and mapping something you know fairly well. For example, you could map you commute to school with significant points of interest along the way or places of interest somewhere you traveled recently;</li>
                    <li>save the data as a <strong>gist</strong>; and</li>
                    <li>submit the <strong>URL</strong> to the resulting gist.</li>
                </ol>
