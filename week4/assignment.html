            <h2>Readings</h2>
            <p>We are going to be getting into making web pages in the next few weeks. Here are some recommended readings to prepare you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">What is Code?</a> This is a long, at times hilarious, article that was in Bloomberg Businessweek last summer. As such, it's meant for a general audience and does an interesting job of introducing readers to programming and programmers. I strongly recommend at least reading a bit of it.</li>
                <li>Start to get used to HTML by reading <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction">Mozilla's Introduction to HTML</a>. It's okay if you're not completely comfortable with this material yet, we will talk about it more next week.</li>
                <li>If you're interested in working ahead a bit, start working on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web">Codecademy's HTML &amp; CSS course</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Part 1: Putting things online with GitHub Pages</h2>
            <p>GitHub is both a place to put open source code and a free way to host pages online. Learn a bit more about them with <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/pages/">this tutorial</a>. Specifically follow along starting at the heading <strong>Setting Up Your First Page</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create an account at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
                <li>Create a repository as specified in the tutorial. The name of the repository should be <strong>yourusername</strong>.github.io. For example, my username is ebrelsford, so mine is called <a href="https://github.com/ebrelsford/ebrelsford.github.io/">ebrelsford.github.io</a>.</li>
                <li>Pick a layout.</li>
                <li>You can stop when you get to the heading <strong>Editing Your First Page</strong>.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Part 2: Make a map related to your project</h2>
            <p>In CARTO make a map that is related to one of your project ideas. Spend some time looking for data. Focus specifically on <strong>layering data</strong> and potential <strong>SQL queries</strong> that make interesting visualizations of the data. Don't forget <strong>legends</strong>, <strong>titles</strong>, and <strong>attribution</strong> where appropriate.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
            <p>Part 1: Submit the public link to your page (<strong>yourusername</strong>.github.io).</p>
            <p>Part 2: Submit a link to your map.</p>
